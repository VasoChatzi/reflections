* What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git starts a new repository for the directory. 
Otherwise, where would we start? It needs to know.

* How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Working directory is just the directory you work in, nothing complicated.
The repository is something that contains all your files and history, that is a lot of info.
The staging area is something that keeps your uncommitted changes so far.
